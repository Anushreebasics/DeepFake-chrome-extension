# FakeFree

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution for detecting facial manipulation in videos, commonly known as deep fakes. With the proliferation of deep fake technology, the need for robust detection methods has become increasingly critical to combat misinformation and safeguard the integrity of video content.

## Features

- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for deep fake detection.
- Ensemble approach with multiple CNN models.
- Integration of attention mechanisms for interpretability and learning.
- Compatible with publicly available datasets for evaluation and testing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
